# Getting Started

## What distribution should I use?

If you want to embed Piranha into your own application you have 2 options, you
can choose between Piranha Nano and Piranha Embedded. If you want to run a
single web application you can use Piranha Micro or Piranha Server. If you want
to run multiple web applications use Piranha Server. If you need a command line
interface to everything Piranha use the Piranha CLI.
